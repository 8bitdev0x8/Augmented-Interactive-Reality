### ABSTRACT ###

>*AIR is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched
experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies, incorporating AR cameras into smartphone applications and object recognition.
The information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and
digitally manipulated. Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the
real world. This information can be virtual or real.
AIR uses the existing environment while overlaying new information on top of it, thereby
allowing us to experience existing reality in a more heightened and engaging way.
Socio-economic relevance is that AIR can be used in the field of medicine in order for
making the surgery easier, can be possible through visualisation method.
There are a number of applications for AIR eg, interior designing, education, sightseeing,
tourism industries Etc.
Our Project we are going to build an AIR application for Interior designing.
Existing solutions that are used for interior designing is by conventional method of 3D
modeling. Where the users do not get interactive models from Designers.
To overcome this AIR application can be used. It provides a platform for the Designers
and 3D artist to create models. Where the user get benefits.
Users can use this application to Interactively design their rooms in Augmented reality.
AIR has many scopes in different fields. For example it can be used in industries for
training people to identify new tools, fix machineries etc.
Expected limitations for AIR as of now is performance. As processors and camera
technology is getting better day by day the user experience gets better and can add
complex polygon design models to the application for better realism.*

Render Viewer is a feature that is Present in AIR Application where Users can View rendered Image in 360 which is Uploaded by the Designer of their choice. 

 ### FRAMEWORK ###
   <img src="/docs/UI/arfoundation.jpeg" >
AR Foundation includes core features from ARKit, ARCore, Magic Leap, and HoloLens, as well as unique Unity features to build robust apps that are ready to ship to internal stakeholders or on any app store. This framework enables you to take advantage of all of these features in a unified workflow.
